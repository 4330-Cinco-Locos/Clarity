### How to Use the Program
- 1A: On the login page, type in your email and password associated with your profile
- 1B: If you do not have a profile made already, click the 'Sign up' button just below the login fields
[note: as this is currently setup for easy demo purposes, any email works for creating an account, so long as it meets email format. This include non-existant emails]
- 2: This will bring you to the login screen. From here select 'Get Started' or the burger menu to navigate to 
other pages

Dashboard: the dashboard functions as a hub, seperate from the welcome page, where users may view any upcoming tasks in the left box, or quickly navigate to the other pages through the right box elements.

Profile: the profile page can be accessed, when logged in, through a button in the top-right of the screen labeled with the users username. When clicked it displays the users profile, including their display name, userID, and email. There are additionally fields to upload a new profile picture and change password.

Kanban Board: The Kanban board consists of 4 parts. The left navbar, which contains a list of all available tasks, a button to create new tasks, and a red field labeled 'Delete Task' to which tasks may be dragged to remove them. The elements on the left navbar are not draggable, but instead give a more clear view of the draggable elements in the main content of the page. The main content of the page consists of 4 task pools to which users may move their tasks according to their urgency. 

Calendar: the calendar is another feature of the program and simply contains a typical calendar layout, with events placed within which show the same tasks that are present in the kanban board, but according to their due date. Users may also select the month | week | day options in the top left to increase or narrow the focus of the calendar

Chatroom: the chatroom contains a text entry field at the bottom of the screen which can be used to send messages to the current channel. To send a message, simply type in you text and click the enter key when finished. Additionally, on the left navbar there are a selection of 'Active Channels', each of these are clickable elements. Clicking one will change the channel the user is currently in. Users can only view messages sent in their current channel and all messages sent while in a channel will be sent to that channel only.
